                <p>*Attention Farmers:This is a crucial update regarding the current water levels in the dam. The dam is approaching its maximum capacity, and we want to ensure that you are prepared and safe.<br>
        
                  Please take the following precautionary measures:
                  
                  1. Monitor Local Alerts: Stay updated with official weather warnings and dam level reports. Local authorities will provide timely information and instructions.</br>
                  
                  2. Check Irrigation Systems: Ensure that your irrigation systems are functioning properly and can handle potential fluctuations in water supply.</br>
                  
                  3. Secure Livestock and Equipment: If necessary, move livestock and valuable equipment to higher ground to avoid potential flooding.</br>
                  
                  4. Review Drainage Plans:Check and clear any drainage systems on your property to facilitate efficient water flow and reduce the risk of flooding.</br>
                  
                  5.Prepare Emergency Supplies: Have an emergency kit ready with essentials such as food, water, and first aid supplies in case of an evacuation.</br>

                <p>Type of Dam:
                  Gravity Dam: The Tungabhadra Dam is a gravity dam, meaning it relies on its weight to resist the force of the water.
                  Height:
                  49.38 meters (162 feet): The height of the dam from the foundation.</br>
                  
                  Length:
                  2,441 meters (8,010 feet): The total length of the dam.</br>
                  Reservoir Capacity:
                  Full Reservoir Level (FRL): 497.74 meters (1,633 feet).
                  Gross Storage Capacity: Approximately 3,760 million cubic meters (MCM).</br>
                  Spillway Capacity:
                  11,500 cubic meters per second (cumecs): The maximum discharge capacity of the spillway.
                  Functional Characteristics</br>
                  Purpose:Irrigation: Provides water for irrigation to the agricultural lands in the Tungabhadra Command Area.
                  Hydropower Generation: Generates hydroelectric power.
                  Flood Control: Helps in controlling floods during the monsoon season.
                  Water Supply: Supplies water for domestic and industrial use.</br>
                  Power Generation:
                  Installed Capacity: The dam has several hydroelectric power stations with a combined capacity of around 72 MW.
